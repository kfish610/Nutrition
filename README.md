# Nutrition
![](About/Preview.png)  

Your colonists need a balanced diet

Nutrition adds five new needs to your colonist, one for each food group:  
- Vegetables  
  - Corn
  - Potatoes
- Fruit  
  - Agave
  - Berries
- Grain  
  - Rice
- Protein
  - Meat
  - Eggs
- Dairy
  - Milk
  - Chocolate

You can also sort your food by these categories

At the beginning, your colonists will start with five mostly full needs, one for each food group. They drop fairly slowly, but you will need to get a source for each food group (Note: Mushrooms and Red Lentils from VGP are protein). If a colonist is missing a food group entirely, they start to get health problems. However, if you keep all food groups high, you get a mood increase instead.

## Mod Support
- Vegetable Garden Project
- RimCuisine  

These mods aren't needed, however, they do add more options to satisfy your food groups.  
This mod should be placed after the core mod, and probably after food mods, but otherwise can be anywhere in the list.

## Languages
- English

If anyone wants to sumbit translations that'd be great, but currently there aren't any languages other than English
