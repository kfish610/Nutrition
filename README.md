# Nutrition
Your colonists need a balanced diet

Nutrition adds five new needs to your colonist, one for each food group:  
- Vegetables  
  - Corn
  - Potatoes
- Fruit  
  - Agave
  - Berries
- Grain  
  - Rice
- Protein
  - Meat
  - Eggs
- Dairy
  - Milk
  - Chocolate

You can also sort your food by these categories

## Mod Support
- Vegetable Garden Project
- RimCuisine  

These mods aren't needed, however, they do add more options to satisfy your food groups.  
This mod should be placed after any food mods, but otherwise can be anywhere in the list.
